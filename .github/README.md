# bizar.re

this is the repository containing the source code to my [personal website](https://bizar.re).
this is a wasm spa written in rust (using [yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew)). 

i've tried to limit any sort of hard-coding so that this repo can be forked and used for your own personal site.
