We figured that we could make the grind more tolerable and **fun** through gamification. Gamification is a tried and tested way of making something that would otherwise be strenuous and/or annoying palatable.

We also liked the idea of a social environment, one where you'd be encouraged by others to continue practicing algorithms and work towards a common goal. A competitive element was introduced too, users could create a `guild` and invite their friends. Solving algorithms while in a guild would increase your guild's overall rating on the global leaderboard, with the idea that the top guilds at the end of a season would receive prizes and one on one access to recruiters at top companies.

Another aspect to the competitive element was your indivdual character. Upon completing an algorithm, depending on how well your solution stacked up against others and some other factors, you would be awarded points. These points could be used to upgrade your character's appearance and purchase `titles`. Users would start off with a lame title like "serf" and work their way up to "monarch". This made it obvious who the top players were on Tavern. 

Nothing like flexing your virtual drip ðŸ’§ðŸ˜Ž.
