the code algo grind is fucking annoying. i know this, u know this, we all know this. but bc solving obscure code problems is ubiquitous in most swe interviews, the grind is basically a necessity. 

there are def things that existed before tavern that made the grind more tolerable. sites like [binary search](https://www.binarysearch.com)__*__, where u can practice algorithms collaboratively and in live time with friends. 

w/ tavern, we wanted to make something that, kinda like binarysearch, makes the grind fun. ofc everything is automatically more fun w/ a couple friends, so there needed to be a social aspect. we wanted the social scope to be a lil bit larger than just adding friends though. we wanted ppl to work together, not on a single coding problem, but rather towards a bigger overall goal. 

end result of this is a `guild` system. basically u invite friends to your guild, and when they solve coding problems they contribute to your guilds overall position on the global leaderboards. friends rep their guilds, and guilds compete against each other. imagine being in a guild with some coworkers or some shit and dusting the fuck outta another team at a rival company on the leaderboards. competitive aspect + social stuff have the potential to make for some pretty fun experiences (as long as it's not *too* competitive).

guild system ties well into another big part of tavern which is kinda like the rpg elements. basically, when u sign up, u get to make and customize a character. thats **your** character, the embodiment of all ur big brain algo solutions lmao. **[jet](https://jetsimon.com) did a fucking amazing job creating the art assets** (and i am forever envious of briliant engineers who are also very good at design & art). anyways, u make ur character, join a guild, and start solving some mf code problems. üòé

solving problems better than other people (factoring in your algo efficiency, LoC, etc) gave you points. you could spend your points on virtual drip to deck out ur character and flex on ppl in your guild & everybody on the leaderboards. 





###### __*__ binarysearch.com is fucking awesome. such a polished site for how young it is, u def gotta check the shit out. [add me](https://binarysearch.com/@/bizarre).
