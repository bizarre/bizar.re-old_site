24ish hrs of a ton of fuck shit lol. 

so many things went wrong and took up way more time than they should have. we had to make compromise after compromise to ensure that we'd make it to the finish line with at *least* a demoable project. im ngl i think we aimed pr high. i mean, fuck, one of the people who peer reviewed tavern accused us of cheating bc they couldn't believe we were able to make something as feature complete as tavern w/ polish and all in just 24 hours. 

we did a lot of work, consumed a lot of caffeine, had a ton of fun.

alice & anthony made a pr cool vid showcasing tavern that i invite u to check out on the [devpost](https://devpost.com/software/tavern-2764g3). while we didnt win any cool prizes from nwHacks, the learning experience, jokes we told, and atmosphere made this hackathon a really awesome 24hrs.

hope to do a couple more hackathons with this team sometime soon.
