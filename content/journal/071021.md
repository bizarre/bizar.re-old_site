took the ol' beamer up island and she broke down in the middle of nowhere. no cell service, battery dead, slept in the car and flagged someone down in the morning who called a tow for us when they got into town. was a pretty funny experience in retrospect. after we got a tow we caught a bus to the nearest city so we could grab a rental, drive back north and collect all our shit from the broken car. car rental place upgraded me to a big ass truck, i was so scared to drive it, was worried they wouldn't give me a rental so kind of lied about my insurance coverage lol. thankfully nothing happened (very lucky). 

ended up arranging the beamer to get towed back to vic, then back to van (where my dad lives). needed a car so stuck around van for a little bit car shopping.

ending up buying a '18 brz ts. almost completely stock, w/ a shit ton of kms on her. has been fun learning stick, stalled a shit ton of times at too many intersections on too many hills, but it may have helped me build some character lol. somehow managed to get two tickets within first two weeks of owning the car lol.

got some nice uel borla headers that are getting installed next week, should help fix the notorious gt86 torque dip. tint too. def gonna mod out this car while i still can, previous owner drove the fuck outta her (almost 100k kms in like 3 years). was also eyeing an wrx sti hatch but had a ton of problems and i needed a whip sooner rather than later. 

addicted to nic again. i think it just gives me something to do. not getting crazy heart palpalations like the last time i was hooked on it, but BC set the max nicotine legal level to like half of what i would use previously so maybe that's why. just switched to a refillable system because i kept buying disposables thinking "one last time" but evidently that was never the case. 

mental health is def at a low point right now. was supposed to be in the middle of a move, but just didn't have it in me. smoking way more weed than i should too. idk, think im just at a weird stage right now. ended up taking the semester off to try and focus more on improving myself. really need to start reintegrating a more developed routine, i felt so much more concrete when i had one. it's crazy the effect routine can have.
