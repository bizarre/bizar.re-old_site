started new job today. it's going to take a bit for the no-longer-a-contracter mental shift but im hyped. everyone i've met here so far has been fucking awesome. i actually got referred by a buddy of mine (shout out [anthony](https://anthonymorris.dev)!!!!), which is one of the reasons why i really fw'd this company. was able to hear ab it firsthand from anthony. 

im going to try and use vim some more. i spent the weekend working on a cool vim setup (from scratch! fuck u spacevim) that i'm excited to try out. also went through `vimtutor`, and vim is actually fucking nuts! i can def see how somebody familiar w/ all the shortcuts (plus w/ their own binds) can transform into a crazy productive beast.

lmao i actually hit my vape during zoom and now i feel like a total asshole.
