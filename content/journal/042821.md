started watching sebastian lague's [Coding Adventures]([Coding Adventures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ehjAfLFsp1PGaatzAwo0uK) series off of a friend's recommendation and it's such a cool series. the first vid in the series the guy simulates an ecosystem with bunnies and foxes programatically where they breed and inherit genes, etc, etc. it's really cool shit and you should def check it out. 

the series has inspired me to kind of do some similar stuff in visualizing mathematical stuff and other things so i added 'sketch' functionality to this site with [p5.js](https://p5js.org). this'll let me fuck around with creating my own coding adventures and they'll be available online and through a browser and i don't even have to leave my personal site project too.

check out the [first sketch](/s/hello-world) (which is just ripped from the example p5.js thingie)
