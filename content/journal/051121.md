got car off dad saturday. had to replace its battery, do some routine stuff and get it insured. ended up costing like ~1k. been having a ton of fun just driving all over the lower mainland. its crazy how many things i can do so easily now. insurance expires in august so i'll be looking to get my own ride by then.

still got that move to figure out. as soon as i get back home ill have to start packing all my shit. gotta make some phones calls and find cheapest + best company that can move my stuff A-Z, etc. going to be a busy couple months, with work, school, this move, and car stuff coming up. also got my bro's bday coming up early june and my mom's visiting from ontario end of june. will be tough trying to squeeze everything in but i should manage. 

debated on taking this semester off entirely, just to focus on everything else. i dropped chemistry over the weekend which should help lessen the load. i *really* did not want to deal with all that lab manual shit right now.

site updates have stagnated as a result of stuff discussed in previous entry. will see if it picks up over the next little while.

been applying to some swe-related roles recently. applied to some cool places, got some interviews lined up. i'm pretty happy with where i'm at right now in terms of flexibility and how awesome my team is. but, with how often i find myself doubting my choice to continue with school, i'm lowkey hoping ill get an offer good enough to make the decision for me. 

we'll see.
