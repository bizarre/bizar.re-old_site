trying to write at least once a day. will see how long i keep it up for. 

so i actually ended up moving to vancouver in september. the move itself was actually kind of annoying. paid movers to take half my furni (anything that couldn't fit in my tiny ass 2dr coupe), and store it indefinently in victoria. then i proceeded to load my tiny ass car with everything left that would fit, and drove it over the ferry. i did this about 3-4 times in order to get everything over. took forever. then had to go back and arrange for cleaners, return garage key to the dude i rented spot from, etc. then back AGAIN 3 weeks later to return the keys to landlord. it was a lot of fucking work man. in retrospect like why the fuck didnt i just A: get the movers to move everything, B: get a uhaul and do it in ONE trip u dumb fuck alex.

## new setup

## pc

as soon as i moved in i set to remake my desktop setup and shit. my old setup was just of a bunch of shit that i basically bought in high school (so was rly old). the first (and probs most important thing) in a pc setup is the pc, so that's what i did first.  

wanted a pc that i wouldn't have to worry ab upgrading for awhile, so i pr much spec'd it all out:  
**rtx 3080 ti, ryzen 5950x, 64gb ram, 2tb nvme ssd**  

also decided to make this pc a lil special and try something new, so decided to build a custom loop. was more work than i expected ngl, cuz i opted to use hard tubing instead of soft tubing, which meant cutting up a bunch of acryllic tubes to size, heating them for bends, etc. ended up burning through so much tubing that i couldn't afford to do any more bends w/o having to wait for more tubing to come in. end-result is a bunch of 90 connectors but i think it looks pr fucking sick still.

the case is so much smaller than my old pc, but its cool having this lil tiny cute purple thing on my desk now :D.

## desk
got the [Fully Jarvis Standing Desk](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis.html). sick desk that can go up or down so it's hella chill. got some addons like a bottle opener, hooks, memory console, integrated power brick, etc that add utility & make some thing easier. getting this desk was a shipping nightmare that took several weeks, but the peeps at Jarvis sent me a free desk lamp to make up for it so fuck it they cool.

## audio
really wanted to up my audio game cuz i wanna do like music production in the future. for the mic i got the Rode NT1 on a Rode PSA1 connected to a Scarlett 4i4 interface. thinking i might need an actual amp, this interface is def overkill for rn. for headphones i got the ATH-R70x's. plugged em into the scarlett and audio was obvi meh, so needed something better to drive em, ended up w/ the Sound Blaster X3's which also have some nice virtual suround sound shit so i can hear footsteps on val better lol. end result is a real clean audio setup imho, mic could use a preamp but outside of that its all pr hi-fi considering.

ok i'd write more but im tired and wanna sleep. will talk more ab setup some other time ig.
