have been working on the `projects` page for the last couple days. it's pretty much all done in terms of code, but am stuck on writing content for one of the projects. it just seems so sell-outy, idk, it reads cringe. not sure if its just because of *how* i wrote it or if there's just always going to be an inherant cringe just due to the nature of the content. i'll probably keep that branch on hold until i figure out what direction i want to take the site.

started summer semester thursday, missed two of my classes. need to get back into the habit of like going to class and shit. the break kinda fucked me up. i think once i get used to my schedule and stuff should be no problem. 

have been working through math textbook+questions & it's been fun. 

got wisdom tooth pulled out today. big fucker of a tooth lol. hurts like shit.
