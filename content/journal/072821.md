tried out [maple](https://www.getmaple.ca). was told ab it by [jet](http://jetsimon.com) (use his [referral link](http://mple.in/36f73ee) if ur interested in signing up lol, $10 off).

so BASICALLY it's like online doctors on demand 24/7. kinda like telus health but because you're actually paying you get more direct access to a physician. you pay per consultation/visit, can talk to doctor via text, voice or video. my prescription ran out yesterday and the earliest i could get an appointment with a doctor on [Babylon](https://www.telus.com/en/personal-health/my-care?linktype=telushealth-home) was in two weeks so i opted to try maple. 

exp was pr decent. got matched w/ a physician in like 5 minutes. explained my situation, sent a photo of my current prescription + my id, answered a couple questions, and 20 minutes later i had a prescription. cool shit. worth close to $100? ehhhh, probs not. honestly the whole doctor situation here is just ridic. on vancouver island u got a better chance winning the lottery than u do at getting a family doctor (unless you're mf born into a family that has/had one already).

will probs do some more work on the site soon. am thinking of adding a flag to journal entries that'll let people know whether an entry contains some sort of technical stuff. idk i feel bad bc no titles so if you're just chilling on the site you have no idea if the journal entry you're going to click on is ab some cool technical shit or just me being depressed. maybe that's the point tho? it depends really. 

i think if the primary objective of this site was to, you know, help people learn cool shit or help solve problems or something, then sure, making specific content easily available makes sense. but i don't think that's the case. i honestly do not expect anybody to read anything outside of *maybe* skimming the latest journal entry at the time they visited the site. so really the primary audience (and this is very sad lmfao) is me. and the greatest beneficiary of the content posted here is me. 

right? idk. im so tired rn. 

honestly, chances are i will look back on these entries and cringe.   
but that's okay.
