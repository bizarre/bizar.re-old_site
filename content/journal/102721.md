working on a cool rust thingie. an application for spawning and interfacing with docker containers over websockets. the part i'm working on right now is the server. the server listens for websocket connections on a specified port, upon a successful ws connection, the server starts a docker container (from a provided image name) and pipes the input/output to the websocket stream. combined with some more frontend logic (like hooking into Xterm for example), the end result is on-demand containers controllale through your browser. nothing crazy, but an opportunity for me to work with rust again, and it's nice having the motivation to work on my own shit again. usually i name my projects something cool, can't think of a name yet (which is why repo is private), currently named `docker web console server` or `dwcs` for short. open to suggestions!

will write more about dwcs (dwicks?) some other time. i need to SLEEP loll
