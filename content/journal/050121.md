rent was due today haha. was low on cash so had to sell a tiny bit of crypto, not happy but at least the market was up. 
otherwise not an eventful day, got some really good matcha boba from a place dt & some pr successful cops from thrifting.

am going to be moving to vancouver soon, aiming for 1st of july, so will probably go to see places some time in june. the stress of moving (especially having to move all my shit over the ferry) might make me procrastinate ðŸ˜¬. but i think im done w/ vic and everything closing at 8pm. trying to get a place in gastown.

got my road test on monday which if i pass will get me a license that'll let me drive alone. unfortunately the place i'm getting the test at has a 50% failure rate so i'm not *too* hopeful.

will probs do another sketch later tonight.
