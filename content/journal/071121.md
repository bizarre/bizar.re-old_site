again i am stuck up island lol. brz got impounded for a week up near port hardy. renting a car to drive home (6hr drive) then flying back up here next week to pick up my baby from impound lot. might temporarily lose license for this one. a very expensive lesson learned (ticket, car rental, impound fees, etc). i feel like i could've talked the ticket down with the police officer to avoid impounding but it's all good. stayed the night at a motel in port mcneil. 2000-people something town. don't think i could live in a place like this, but it's been cool to check it out. should be home later today (fingers crossed). going to have to reschedule some work on the car i had booked for later this week (tint & header install + tune). this does not help my already deteriorating mental state but i'm trying to make the best out of it. i shouldn't have been speeding as much as i was lol.
