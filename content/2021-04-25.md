added syntax highting for code blocks to this site using [prismjs](https://prismjs.com). was kind of weird to add because it's supposed to be inserted at the bottom of html body because it tries to evaluate all elements on the page to find code blocks to highlight. problem is that all this shit is loaded dynamically (and i also cannot even insert shit at the bottom of body because trunk will remove it). 

found a blog post from like 2011 where person said to run `Prism.highlightAll()` after AJAX content is loaded to get prism to re-eval. now i insert a script tag containing that line of code at the bottom of each journal entry to get highlighting to work. tried to just eval that js using js bindings on render function but it got ran *before* the actual render. didn't want to have some ghetto setup where i set timeout or something, so end result is appending that script tag:

```rust
let script = web_sys::window()
.unwrap()
.document()
.unwrap()
.create_element("script")
.unwrap();

script.set_inner_html("Prism.highlightAll()");

let script_node = Node::from(script);
let script_vnode = VNode::VRef(script_node);
```

```rust
 html! {
  <div>
    ...
    <section>
      ...
      <> {script_vnode} </>
    </section>
    ...
  </div>
}
```

as you can see it works. 

i think there's like a post-render function as part of yew component lifecycle i could add and then eval the js there instead. but that would mean re-introducing `js-sys` as a dependency and this solution works rn w/o any other changes. 

hoping ill have time to do some more non-web rust stuff soon. as fun as working on this site has been, is it extreme metaprogramming and i kind of miss that tradid rust vibe. dont have school for a couple weeks but have a ton of stuff to catch up on at work (lil behind bc of exams) so *probably* wont get around to it.
