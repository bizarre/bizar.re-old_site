hi, i'm alex. i am a 21yo comp sci student currently living in victoria, bc.

i like to [write code](https://github.com/bizarre), take photos & i am currently teaching myself how to play guitar.

despite being a comp sci student for less than a year i have been programming since i was 10. there's a ton of stuff i want to explore within tech, i'm especially interested and fascinated by:

* scale
  * the idea that a tiny thing on its own when multiplied and ran at scale can have huge repercussions is really cool
* robotics
  * i love being able to see my code manifest in the physical world, and i really want to explore robotics and related tech (i still have to set up this raspberry pi)
  * i got into programming through my elementary school's lego robotics club, so i feel like it would be poetic if i somehow circled back to the idea of robotics somewhere along my career.
* low level goodness
  * i have spent so much time in the higher level areas of programming that i am more and more facinated by things lower level. i want to start working on my own kernel in rust soon.

i also really enjoy product design, being involved in all stages of the process, and seeing stuff to fruition. my early programming experience is specifically app development related, where users have to install my software. when i got into web development i was really intrigued by just how much more accessible my programs became, especially with the ability to decouple app logic from frontend logic. i love building in the web, even more so when i can mess around with the cutting edge.

this site you're on right now is written in rust (understood by your browser via wasm ([yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew)) w/ tailwind, you can read a tiny bit of the technical challenges, etc [here](/042421). the source code is available [here](https://github.com/bizarre/bizarre). 

**i will warn you that my posts are unfiltered and contain profanity**. 
if there is any place to be opinionated it is on your personal site, so have fun sifting through the recesses of my brain, sometimes there's a cool technical related thing somewhere around.
